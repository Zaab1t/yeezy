Password phrases are _the_ way the to stay safe online. Who better to say the phrase than beloved street poet Kanye "Yeezy" West?

With yeezy you can generate password phrases with a Kanye West-based markov chain!


## Why pass phrases?
Your password is most likely 8 characters, where the two middle ones are numbers.

It's hard to remember a random sequence, but computers don't know the difference. When a website tells you your password must be x chars long, include lower- and uppercase letters and numbers, it's only making it easier for a cracker to iterate over the possibilities (because there are fewer because of the restrictions). A good password is a long one, and a good website allows a large alphabet but uses no other restrictions than length.
